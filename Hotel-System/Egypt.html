                    kilometres from the city centre.
                    Our 5-star hotel is just 65 kilometres from Cairo International Airport, with relaxation and

                    Our luxury hotel is only 20 kilometres from the Great Pyramids of Giza and Sphinx, and just a short
                    stroll from Dream Park,
                    one of the Middle East’s most famous amusement parks as well as a 27-hole golf course.
                    A 20-km drive will take you to the new Egyptian Museum so you can wander through the different eras
                    of ancient Egyptian history.
                    With the first Aqua Park in a 5-star hotel in the region, we have created an unforgettable
